# Getting Started with Guess the Number Game

This game makes use of the Binaray Search Algorithm to quickly find the player's number in the array <br /> 
of numbers given for players to make their guesses. 

## Scripts

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## How to play
Users will see random numbers appear in the game cards. Pay close attention to the numbers because players only have <br />
three guesses to choose the correct number. Players may use the input to enter their guess or click on the number card. If using the input, players will receive a 'number too high' or 'number too low' if the number is incorrect. A counter at the bottom of the card informs the user of how many attempts they have used. Select the correct number by the third attempt to win. <br />
To play again, simply click the play again button.
